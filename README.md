# Evolutive Computing: Examples
Examples of expert systems in Python:

1. Genetic algorithms: This folder contains examples of genetic algorithms optimization using different representations and selection methods. We analyze functions such as Rosenbrock, Ackley, Eggholder, TSP problem and the 8-Queen problem.

2. Multiobjective optimization: This folder contains examples of multiobjective optimization using DEAP. We analyze the Viennet function.

3. Final proyect: This folder contains a simple program that solves a 3x3 Sudoku using genetic algorithms. We also test the results obtained in 5 iterations and plot a graph with the results. 

Just try with python and the filename.
